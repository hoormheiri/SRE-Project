Project description 
vm_0 
this is where we ran the Prometheus Server
To handle alerts generated by Prometheus, we installed AlertManager on vm_0. AlertManager is responsible for managing alerts and routing them to the appropriate notification channels.
We acquired the latest version of AlertManager from the official repository. After downloading the package, we extracted the contents to access the AlertManager binary.
We moved the AlertManager binary to the standard executable directory and created a dedicated user for running AlertManager. Ownership and permissions were set accordingly. We then created a systemd service file to manage AlertManager, ensuring it starts automatically with the system and operates in the background.



Task 3
We configured AlertManager to send email notifications for triggered alerts. This setup ensures that alert notifications are sent to designated recipients.
We edited the AlertManager configuration file to include settings for sending emails. This involved specifying the SMTP server details, the sender’s email address, authentication credentials, and the recipients of the notifications.
We edited the AlertManager configuration file to include settings for sending emails. This involved specifying the SMTP server details, the sender’s email address, authentication credentials, and the recipients of the notifications.
After updating the configuration file, we reloaded the AlertManager service to apply the new settings.


Task 5

We created Prometheus rules to monitor resource usage during stress tests and set up alerting conditions to notify when resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
We defined Prometheus alerting rules to monitor CPU, memory, disk, and SQL usage. The rules specify the conditions under which alerts are triggered, such as when resource usage exceeds 70%.
We configured these rules to work with AlertManager to ensure that alerts are processed and notifications are sent out when conditions are met.


vm_1 
this is where we ran the Mysql Server

To monitor system-level and MySQL-specific metrics on vm_1, we installed two important Prometheus exporters: Node Exporter and MySQLD Exporter.
Node Exporter Installation:
We obtained the latest version of Node Exporter from the official repository. After downloading the package, we extracted its contents to access the Node Exporter binary.
We moved the Node Exporter binary to a standard location for executable files. A dedicated user was created for running Node Exporter to enhance security by restricting login capabilities. The correct ownership and permissions were set for the binary. Finally, we created a systemd service file to manage the Node Exporter as a background service, ensuring it starts automatically with the system.
Similarly, we downloaded the latest version of MySQLD Exporter. After extracting the downloaded package, we prepared the binary for installation.
We moved the MySQLD Exporter binary to the appropriate location and set up a dedicated user for the exporter. Ownership and permissions were adjusted accordingly. A systemd service file was created for MySQLD Exporter to manage it as a background service, ensuring it starts automatically and runs continuously.


task 4
We developed a Python script to perform various stress tests on vm_1, including CPU, memory, disk, and SQL stress testing.
 We wrote a Python script that provides a menu for selecting different types of stress tests. The script uses system tools to execute the stress tests based on user input.
We tested the script to ensure it correctly performs the selected stress tests and handles the stress scenarios as expected.


MySQLD Exporter Installation:
vm_2
this is where we ran the Grafana Server

Task 6
We set up Grafana on vm_2 to visualize and monitor metrics collected by Node Exporter and MySQLD Exporter during stress tests.
We installed Grafana on vm_2 and started the service.
We imported pre-built dashboards for Node Exporter and MySQLD Exporter into Grafana. These dashboards display key metrics and performance data, allowing us to monitor system and database performance visually.
